## Deployment Steps

### 1. GitHub Classroom Setup
1. **Create New Assignment**
   - Go to GitHub Classroom organization
   - Click "New Assignment" â†’ "Individual Assignment"
   - Title: "Day 3: Memory Management and Data Structures with AI Integration"

2. **Configure Template Repository**
   - Template repository: `https://github.com/overcookedlobster/day3-memory-structures-ai`
   - Grant students read access to template
   - Enable autograding (automatically detected)

3. **Assignment Settings**
   - **Deadline**: Set appropriate deadline (recommended: 1 week)
   - **Enable feedback pull requests**: Yes
   - **Grant students admin access**: No
   - **Enable autograding**: Yes
   - **Supported editors**: Any (VS Code, CLion, etc.)

### 2. Student Communication

í ¾í´– **AI Integration**: Document all AI tool usage in ai_docs/AI_USAGE_LOG.md

í ½í³‹ **Tasks**:
1. Pointer Operations (15 pts)
2. Structure Design (15 pts)
3. Bit Manipulation (15 pts)
4. Multi-Chip Arrays (15 pts)
5. AI Integration (15 pts)
+ Build system, memory safety, code quality tests

í ½í´— **Accept Assignment**: [GITHUB_CLASSROOM_LINK]

âš ï¸ **Important**: Start early! This is a comprehensive assignment requiring significant implementation work.
```

### 3. Instructor Preparation

**Before Assignment Launch:**
- [ ] Review `INSTRUCTOR_GUIDE.md` for grading procedures
- [ ] Set up monitoring for common student issues
- [ ] Prepare office hours schedule for assignment support
- [ ] Review reference solution in `reference-solution/` directory

**During Assignment Period:**
- [ ] Monitor autograding results for systematic issues
- [ ] Provide feedback on early submissions
- [ ] Address common compilation/implementation problems
- [ ] Review AI documentation quality manually

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Week 1: Initial Submissions
- **Monitor**: Compilation failures and basic functionality
- **Common Issues**: Missing includes, header guard problems
- **Action**: Provide clarifying announcements or FAQ updates

### Week 2: Implementation Phase
- **Monitor**: Function implementation progress, memory safety issues
- **Common Issues**: TODO stubs not replaced, null pointer errors
- **Action**: Targeted help sessions, debugging workshops

### Final Week: Integration & Polish
- **Monitor**: AI documentation quality, integration test failures
- **Common Issues**: Incomplete AI logs, cross-component integration
- **Action**: Review sessions, final Q&A

## Success Metrics

### Autograding Effectiveness
- **Target**: >80% of students pass compilation tests
- **Target**: >70% of students pass functionality tests
- **Target**: >60% of students pass integration tests
- **Target**: >90% of students submit AI documentation

### Learning Outcomes
- Students demonstrate pointer safety and proper memory management
- Students implement complex data structures (ChipState, ChipSystem)
- Students master bit manipulation for hardware register control
- Students use AI tools responsibly with critical evaluation

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Autograding Issues

**Compilation Failures:**
```bash
# Debug locally:
make clean && make all
gcc -Wall -Wextra -std=c11 -Iinclude src/[file].c -o bin/[file] -lm
```

**Memory Safety Failures:**
```bash
# Test with AddressSanitizer:
gcc -fsanitize=address -g -Iinclude src/[file].c -o bin/[file]_debug -lm
./bin/[file]_debug
```

**Test Script Issues:**
```bash
# Make scripts executable:
chmod +x tests/*.sh
# Test individual scripts:
./tests/test_[category].sh
```

### Student Support Resources

**Quick Start Guide:**
1. `git clone [repository-url]`
2. `cd day3-memory-structures-ai`
3. `make all` (should compile with warnings)
4. `./bin/chip_monitor` (should run with TODO messages)
5. Start implementing functions in `src/` files

**Debugging Commands:**
```bash
make debug          # Compile with debugging symbols
make test           # Run all tests
make valgrind       # Memory leak detection
make clean          # Clean build artifacts
```
