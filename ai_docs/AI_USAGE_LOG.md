# AI Usage Log - Day 3 Assignment

## Overview
This document tracks all AI interactions during the completion of Day 3: Memory Management and Data Structures assignment. Students must document every AI tool usage, evaluation, and decision-making process.

## Template Instructions
**IMPORTANT**: Students must replace this template with their actual AI interactions. Each entry should include:
- Date and time of interaction
- AI tool used (ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Claude, etc.)
- Specific prompt or question asked
- AI response summary
- Your evaluation of the response
- What you accepted/rejected and why
- Final implementation decisions

## AI Interaction Log

### Example Entry (Replace with your actual interactions)

**Date**: 2024-01-15 14:30
**AI Tool**: ChatGPT-4
**Task**: Task 3 - Bit Operations

**Prompt**: "Help me implement a function to extract a multi-bit field from a 32-bit register. I need to extract bits 8-11 (4 bits) from a control register."

**AI Response Summary**:
AI suggested using bit shifting and masking: `(reg >> start_bit) & ((1 << width) - 1)`

**My Evaluation**:
- ✅ **Accepted**: The bit manipulation logic is correct
- ✅ **Accepted**: The approach is efficient and readable
- ❌ **Rejected**: AI didn't include bounds checking for bit positions
- ❌ **Modified**: Added validation for start_bit and width parameters

**Final Implementation**:
```c
uint32_t extract_field(uint32_t reg, int start_bit, int width) {
    if (start_bit < 0 || start_bit >= 32 || width <= 0 || width > 32) {
        return 0; // Added bounds checking
    }
    return (reg >> start_bit) & ((1U << width) - 1U); // Used AI suggestion with unsigned literal
}
```

**Learning**: AI provided good algorithmic foundation but missed edge case handling. Always add proper validation.
